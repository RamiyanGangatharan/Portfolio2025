        I believe in keeping every step of my work transparent. 
          From diagnosing hardware issues to developing software, 
          I explain what needs to be done, why it matters, and what options you have. 
          My goal is to ensure you understand the process, so there are no surprises and 
          you feel confident in the solutions I provide. Typically, I start with an initial 
          meeting (preferably in person) to discuss your needs and goals.
          Next, I brainstorm and plan based on our discussion. For hardware, this might involve 
          running diagnostics and identifying potential issues. For software projects like websites 
          or applications, I create diagrams and mockups to visualize the solution. This planning 
          phase is often the longest, but investing time here ensures smoother execution and better results.
          The third step is execution. I carry out the planned tasks while documenting everything, what was done, 
          any challenges encountered, and updates for you. For example, if replacing a CPU, I might need extra 
          time to resolve firmware or driver issues, and I always keep the client informed along the way.
          Finally, I deliver the finished product and review it with you. This includes testing, final adjustments, 
          and explaining any changes or improvements made. By following this transparent, step-by-step approach, 
          you always know what's happening, why it's happening, and the value you're getting.
